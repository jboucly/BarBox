# BarBox

I am building an automatic bar, using a raspberry pi, relays and pumps. 
This is the code for the user interface. But I would need some help to make it look better and add a progression bar or an animation while the drink is being served.
And if you have any ideas to make it better?

This what the web page looks like at the moment :
